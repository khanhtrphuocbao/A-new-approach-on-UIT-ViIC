# A-new-approach-on-UIT-ViIC
# Abstract:
Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a task that combines computer vision and natural language processing. In this paper, we present a method to build a Vietnamese VQA dataset by automatically generating question-answer pairs from the annotations in the existing UIT-ViIC image annotation dataset. We describe the tools used, analyze the challenges encountered during the dataset construction process, and discuss the solutions implemented to overcome them.
